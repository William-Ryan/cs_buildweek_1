# John Conway's Game Of Life
## Introduction
In this Project I created the life cell simulation known as the Game Of Life. The objective in this project was to take my core track curriculum, and apply what I learned from computer science to create a successful recreation of this game within a week's time.

## Accomplishments
- The project uses a method called "double-buffering" in this project its effect is that though visually you can see the actions taking place there is always a preloaded step for each generation of cells.
- Multiple approaches for how to run the simulation you can create a random preset of cells throughout the grid and you can click throughout the grid to create your own patterns.
- Color visualization for the cells as well as a gradient background creates a basic but visually pleasing UI.

## Challenges
- Implementing "double-buffering" requires keeping a constant track on the data in the form of the current and future step to generate the results of an algorithm in a more efficient manner.
- This was my first attempt at implementing a project such as this requiring understanding simulation as well as displaying the visuals that are applied to it's results.

## What's Next?
- 3d visuals for the game
- Updated UI displaying more options for presets 
- description for the algorithm/game on the initial landing page or a separate one.

### How to start the game
- Clone down the repo
- npm install required dependencies in the game-of-life file
- npm start on game-of-life file
- Enjoy!
